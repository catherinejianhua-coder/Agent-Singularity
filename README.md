## 🌐 The Vision

As Autonomous Agents evolve from simple application-layer tools into complex social infrastructure, the industry is facing a paradigm shift from "script-based integration" toward **architectural standardization**.

This research (core theory finalized and submitted to arXiv on **January 20, 2026**) introduces the **Agent Metabolic System (AMS)**. AMS is not merely a specific tool but a **General Reference Architecture** designed to provide the foundational blueprint for the next decade of embodied AI and sovereign compute.

## 📅 Context & Priority Statement

This research captures a critical foresight into industry trends just before the global surge of autonomous agent platforms:
* **2026-01-20**: Core 7-layer metabolic theory locked and submitted to arXiv.
* **2026-01-27**: Popular adoption of application-layer platforms like OpenClaw (Moltbot) surged.
* **Current Context**: Recent industry debates regarding agent sovereignty and security boundaries have validated the necessity of the **L4 Sovereignty Layer** and **L3 Risk-Aware Routing** proposed in this paper.

While current platforms excel at connectivity, AMS provides the missing **system-level safety theory** and **deterministic execution framework** required for high-stakes deployment.

## 💡 Key Contributions: The AMS 7-Layer Model

Just as the OSI model defined the standards for internet communication, the **AMS 7-Layer Model** defines the logic for agent survival and evolution as independent systems. Its value lies in its **high level of generalization** and **predictive power**:

### 1. A General Blueprint for Standardization
AMS abstracts agent functions into a static 7-layer stack, from "signal perception" to "physical settlement." The model's definitions of **Perception (L1-L2), Governance (L3-L4), and Execution (L5-L7)** are platform-agnostic, serving as a foundation for future agent interoperability.

### 2. Deterministic Execution (100% Deadline Compliance)
Addressing the primary bottleneck for agents in the physical world—**Latency Jitter**—we introduce Stochastic Control Barriers:
* **Evaluation**: Under volatile network conditions, the AMS architecture achieves **100% hard deadline compliance**, ensuring that critical tasks (e.g., hardware control, financial settlement) never time out.

### 3. Physical Sovereignty (The Sovereign Core)
The paper anticipates the need for physically isolated identity roots. Through the **L4 Sovereignty Layer**, the system enforces a semantic-level firewall, structurally eliminating risks of context leakage and unauthorized command execution.

## 📊 Technical Evaluation Summary

Based on $N=2000$ discrete-event simulations, we compared the AMS architecture against traditional application-layer frameworks:

| Metrics | Traditional Wrappers | **AMS Architecture (Ours)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **System Level** | Application Logic | **Systemic Metabolism** |
| **Task Compliance (Hard Deadline)** | ~81.2% (Affected by Tail Latency) | **100.0% (Deterministic Guarantee)** |
| **Sovereignty Protection** | Protocol-dependent | **Physical L4 Isolation** |
| **Primary Use Case** | Automation Scripts / Chat | **Embodied AI / Industrial / Sovereignty** |
